Inside the "Form" folder you will find:
 - a written plan for the form as well as notes on decisions made. 
 - An extremely simple HTML Form aptly named "Form"

Inside the "Tax_Super_Calculation" folder you will find:
 - A Javascript file run through cmd using a javascript framework 
   (e.g "node taxSuper.js") It will ask for either gross salary amount or "test" 
   for tests

Please Note:
The questions asked in the form as well as almost all the 
intricacies of tax calculation have been overlooked for this 
simple excercise as I felt you simply wanted me to create a 
program using only the information provided (the tax bracket table) 
as well as the standard rate for Super (9.5%) and standard super tax
rates.
